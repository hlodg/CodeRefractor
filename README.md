# CodeRefractor
Horiseon is an online website that provides information about the company.
Using HTML and CSS, we created this basic front end to the webpage in order to support the company's advertising.

#Refractoring Notes
Ultimately, by consolidating the CSS as well as changing the HTML to include fewer divs, this website became more readable to not only the user but the deeloper.
